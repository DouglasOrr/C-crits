C-crits puts you in charge of an army of miniature robot critters. Lacking the intended C compiler you can program them in the assembly-like language crasm.

Play this game, learn a new & completely useless programming language, get frustrated at its creator (you're welcome), and conclude that even javascript isn't all that bad.

Glossary:

- CRASM - CRitters ASseMbly language, your tool of choicenecessity
- CRAP - CRitters Advanced Pathfinding, for going A ~> B
- CREPL - Curse, Retry, Edit, Pray, Lose, the core gameplay loop
- Compiler - synonym of player
- SECRETS - no
